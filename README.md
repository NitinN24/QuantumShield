### Steps to Push Your Code to GitHub:

1.  **Save Your Files:**
    Make sure you have saved the `index.html` file (and the `README.md` file I provided) in a dedicated folder on your computer (e.g., `quantum-shield-nexus`).

2.  **Initialize a Git Repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project folder, and initialize a new Git repository:
    \`\`\`bash
    cd path/to/your/quantum-shield-nexus-folder
    git init
    \`\`\`

3.  **Add Your Files to the Repository:**
    Add all the files in your project to the Git staging area:
    \`\`\`bash
    git add .
    \`\`\`

4.  **Commit Your Changes:**
    Commit the added files with a descriptive message:
    \`\`\`bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit: QuantumShield Nexus landing page"
    \`\`\`

5.  **Create a New Repository on GitHub:**

    - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in to your account.
    - Click the **"+"** icon in the top right corner and select **"New repository"**.
    - Give your repository a name (e.g., `quantum-shield-nexus`).
    - (Optional) Add a description.
    - Choose whether it's Public or Private.
    - **Do NOT** check "Add a README file", "Add .gitignore", or "Choose a license" as you're pushing existing files.
    - Click **"Create repository"**.

6.  **Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub:**
    After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see instructions. Copy the two lines under "…or push an existing repository from the command line". It will look something like this (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual details):
    \`\`\`bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
    git branch -M main
    \`\`\`
    Paste these commands into your terminal and press Enter.

7.  **Push Your Code to GitHub:**
    Finally, push your committed changes from your local repository to GitHub:
    \`\`\`bash
    git push -u origin main
    \`\`\`

Your code, along with the `README.md` file, should now be visible in your GitHub repository!
